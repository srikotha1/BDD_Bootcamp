    <p>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing/building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding)</p>

        <h2>Machine language</h2>
        <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation.</p>
        <p>Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses.</p>
        <p>However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages</p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ol>
            <li>ADD X</li>
            <li>TOTAL</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

        <h2>Compiler languages</h2>
        <p>High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[12] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'</p>
        <p>FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] and many other languages were soon developedâ€”in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.</p>
        <p>These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target for varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. </p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ol>
            <li>FORTRAN</li>
            <LI>COBOL</LI>
        </ol>

        <h2>Source code entry</h2>
        <p>Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers.</p>
        <p>Text editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.</p>

        <h1>Programming languages</h1>
        <p>Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference</p>
        <p>Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute</p>
        <p> Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.</p>
        <p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Input: Gather data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.</li>
            <li>Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</li>
            <li>Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
